For anything that throws an exception, it is collected.  This includes bugs and error conditions I've been too lazy to clean up properly.

1)
Too many state elements (arrays or streams)
Message: Insufficient <node type>: required-<x> capacity-<y>
Collected: not by default
Factor: required/capacity

2)
Required II exceeds max
Message: ERROR: Required II for mapping exceeds maxII of x (Current II y)
Collected: Don't think so
Factor: required/max

3)
Scheduler failed to find a valid schedule within resource limitations
Message: Scheduling failed
Collected: probably, but will show up as RouterResult.NO_ROUTE
Factor: ???

4)
Placement Failure - probably from too small of an architecture, but the scheduler would likely fail first, unless scheduling is not run
Message: Could not complete initial placement: node "+dataflowNode+" unplaced.
Collected: probably, but will show up as RouterResult.NO_ROUTE
Factor: ???

5)
Routing Failure (if continue on congestion is specified, message will be output, and SPR will retry with higher II)
Message: "Router Failure - Congested nodes:"
 <List of congested nodes>
Collected: yes : RouterResult.CONGESTION
Factor: 

6)
Run out of SPR iterations (if continue on congestion is specified)
Message: lots of either "Router Failure - Congested nodes:" or "Total number of connections requiring padding: <non-zero number>" right before "Best cost = <large number>, <the same non-zero number>"
Collected: yes : RouterResult.CONGESTION or RouterResult.NO_ROUTE, depending on whether the last iteration was a router failure or a placer failure

7)
Exceeded allotted SPR run time
Message: Exceeded maximum compile time!
Collected:  not by default
